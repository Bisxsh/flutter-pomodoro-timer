# flutter-pomodoro-timer
A simple Pomodoro app I made when learning flutter. Design inspired by the [Pomodoro Timer app by AppFx](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pomodrone.app&hl=en_GB&gl=US)

I also created this app using react-native (check it out [here](https://github.com/Bisxsh/react-native-pomodoro-timer) ðŸ˜‰) so I could compare and contrast the developer experience between the two cross-platform mobile frameworks.

# How to run using flutter
```
# clone the project and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/Bisxsh/react-native-pomodoro-timer.git;

# install dependencies
flutter pub get

# start development environment
flutter run
```
